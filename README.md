# My Portfolio

## Overview
This is a sample portfolio webiste. The website includes a dark and night mode too. Feel free to give this a fork and include some concepts for yourself

## Experience
I would say that this is the climax of most of the concepts I have studied in HTML, CSS and Javascript as this was a very challenging exercise for me. I did learn many new concepts and it was a stressful but fun experience. This might also just be the longest code I have written
